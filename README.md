# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game where you can either play against a computer opponent or against a human opponent. (Online multiplayer is not supported)

The AI is designed to be smart but not unbeatable. It will react to simple game logic but advanced strategies will easily defeat. However, take care not to underestimate it. It has already surprised a few people.

As always make sure that you have all of the program assets in the same folder as the Tic-Tac-Toe.py file.

I've extensively bug tested this program but if you should happen to find any new errors please comment them on the program's Github page.
